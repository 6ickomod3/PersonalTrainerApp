**Release Date:** November 30, 2025  
**Status:** Production Ready ✨

---

## 🎉 Welcome to v1.0.0!

Personal Trainer App is now officially released and ready for production use. This comprehensive fitness companion helps you track workouts, manage exercises, organize training by muscle group, and achieve your fitness goals with customizable training targets.

---

## ✨ What's New in v1.0.0

### Customizable Training Goals
Every exercise now has its own **improvement percentage goal**. Instead of a fixed 3% increase, you can:
- Set 5% improvement for compound lifts (Squat, Deadlift)
- Set 2% for isolation exercises (Curls, Raises)
- Adjust based on recovery and training phase
- See personalized suggestions that match YOUR goals

### Smart Suggested Volume
The suggested volume feature is now smarter:
- **Based on previous workouts only** - today's logged sets don't affect tomorrow's suggestion
- **Dynamically displays** your custom improvement percentage
- **Excludes today's data** for unbiased training targets
- Helps you plan realistic daily goals

### Professional App Icon
Your app now has a custom icon that displays on:
- Home screen with perfect sizing
- App switcher
- Settings app
- All iOS interfaces
